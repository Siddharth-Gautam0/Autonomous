# Autonomous Driving
This project is based upon Udacity's Self Driving Simulator Course.

Run the simulator in manual mode and record for around 5 laps.
Execute AutoDrive.py to train your model on the recorded data.

Run the simulator in the autonomous mode, and execute drive.py

The simulator can be installed from here:
