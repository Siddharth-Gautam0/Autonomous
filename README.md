# Autonomous Driving
This project is based upon Udacity's Self Driving Simulator Course.

Run the simulator in manual mode and record data for around 5 laps.
Execute AutoDrive.py to train your model on the recorded data.

Run the simulator in the autonomous mode, and execute drive.py with the model as the command line arguement.

The simulator can be installed from here:
